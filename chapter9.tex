\chapter {Constructing the Algorithm}

\section{Attributes}
Most ranking algorithms as have been discussed, mainly revolve around some combination of voting and time. While some have more complicated parameters, they are usually tailored to the website's philosophy, such as the use of  the penaltiy attribute in Hacker Rank. However, since this project aims to provide the user with an automated display of the most relevant news tailored to the user's interests, voting will be replaced with the user's interests. To elaborate, the user is able to select interests in their account page which have a score associated to them. The time of a post created is a valuable attribute and is benefetial to be used, since it can never be the same even if all the parameters are the same, differentiating in that way two pottentially similar posts.
