\chapter*{Abstract}

This Report describes the design and implementation process for a web based system that provides it's users a personalized view of the top social news depending on their interests. Moreover, in order to achieve this, the report will also focus on implementing some of the most popular ranking algorithm which will then be compared with each other in order to select the most appropriate for the project.

This report will loosely be split in two parts. The first being understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each ranking algorithm and comparing them to find the most suitable. The second part which will focus entirely on the implementation using an agile development methodology.

All in all the aim of this report will be to explain the challenges I face during the comparison process as well as the development process.
